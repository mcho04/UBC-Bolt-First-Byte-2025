## **🏅 3rd Place out of 40 Teams**

🧠 Focus: Data-Driven Strategies to Boost Vancouver City FC’s Revenue
🛠 Tools: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib), Tableau, Google Slides

📘 Overview

This project was developed for the BOLT UBC First Byte 2025 Datathon, where our team served as data consultants for Vancouver City FC, a fictional football club in the BOLT Soccer League (BSL).
We analyzed three key datasets — Stadium Operations, Merchandise Sales, and Fanbase Engagement — to uncover insights and propose actionable strategies to improve total revenue.

🚀 Key Insights

Identified October sales paradox: stadium revenue peaked while merchandise sales dropped sharply.

Found that most sales occurred online, indicating underutilized in-stadium traffic.

Proposed three main strategies:

1. Launch exclusive quarterly merchandise to encourage repeat purchases.

2. Offer a 5% in-store discount to boost stadium purchases.

3. Introduce a “ticket + youth merch” bundle giving 15% off to young fans who attend games.
